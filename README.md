# Graph-Based Traffic Scheduling System

## Overview
This project is a Graph-Based Traffic Scheduling System designed to optimize traffic flow using graph concepts. The system models traffic intersections as nodes and roads as edges to analyze and manage congestion efficiently.

## Objectives
- To understand and apply graph data structures in real-world problems
- To simulate traffic scheduling using algorithms
- To improve traffic management and reduce congestion

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Swing (for GUI)
- Graph Data Structures
- Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Shortest Path concepts)

## Features
- Graph representation of traffic networks
- Efficient traffic scheduling logic
- User-friendly graphical interface
- Modular and well-structured code

## Concepts Covered
- Data Structures
- Graph Theory
- Algorithms
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in any Java-supported IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ / NetBeans)
3. Compile and run the main Java file
